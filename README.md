This is the matlab source codes for our paper published in Plosone in 2016, "Retrieval of Brain Tumors by Adaptive Spatial Pooling and Fisher Vector Representation". 

The two main programs you need to run begin with "main_". Before running the codes, you need to:
1. dowload the image data and uncompress them into the folder "imageData". You can download the data from [here](https://figshare.com/articles/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427).
2. add the folder "vlfeat-0.9.20" and its subfolders to matlab search path.
